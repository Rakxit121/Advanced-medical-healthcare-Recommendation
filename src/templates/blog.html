    <h2 class="text-center">Building a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App with Flask and Machine Learning</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever.
        With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, we embarked on a journey to develop a
        symptom-based disease diagnosis web application. Leveraging Flask for the backend and a Decision Tree Classifier
        model, we created a user-friendly platform that can help users identify potential illnesses based on their
        reported symptoms.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>We recognized a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health
      concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. Our
      goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.</p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a
      pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms.
      Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app supports a
        wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
      <li><b>Machine Learning Model:</b> We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing symptoms and
        corresponding diseases. The model predicts diseases based on the input symptoms.</li>
      <li><b>Prediction:</b> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users with instant
        information about potential health concerns.</li>
      <li><b>Additional Information:</b> The app also provides additional information about the predicted disease,
        including a description, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> The web app boasts an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring that
        users can input their symptoms without any hassle.</li>
      <li><b>Accurate Predictions:</b> Leveraging machine learning, our model provides accurate disease predictions
        based on the symptoms provided by the user.</li>
      <li><b>Comprehensive Information:</b> The app offers comprehensive information about the predicted disease,
        including descriptions, precautions, medications, diet recommendations, and workout tips.</li>
      <li><b>Educational Content:</b> To empower users with knowledge, the app includes informative blog posts about
        various health topics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Our Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App brings the power of machine learning and healthcare information to
      the fingertips of users. It serves as a valuable resource for individuals looking to gain insights into their
      health conditions quickly and conveniently. By combining technology and healthcare, we aim to make healthcare more
      accessible and user-centric.</p>

    <p>In an era where remote healthcare solutions are gaining prominence, this project represents a significant step
      forward in providing accessible and reliable healthcare information to the masses. We hope this project will
      contribute to better health awareness and ultimately improve the well-being of individuals worldwide.</p>
